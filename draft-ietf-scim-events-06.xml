                This specification defines a set of SCIM Security Events using the Security Event Token Specification
                RFC8417 to enable the asynchronous exchange of messages between SCIM Service Providers
                and receivers. SCIM Security Events are typically used for: asynchronous request completion, resource
                replication, and provisioning co-ordination.

            <name>Introduction and Overview</name>
            <t>
                This specification defines Security Events for SCIM Service Providers and receivers as specified by the
                Security Event Tokens (SET) <xref target="RFC8417" format="default"/> specification. SCIM Security
                Events in this specification include: asynchronous request completion, resource replication, and
                provisioning co-ordination.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification also profiles the use of the HTTP Header "<tt>Prefer: Async-response</tt>" <xref target="RFC7240"/>
                to allow a SCIM Protocol Client <xref target="RFC7644"/> to request an asynchronous response (see <xref target="asyncRequest"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
                In a typical HTTP client-server relationship, a SCIM Protocol Client issues commands to a SCIM Service
                Provider using HTTP methods such as POST, PATCH, and DELETE <xref target="RFC7644" format="default"/>
                that cause a state change to a SCIM Resource. When multiple independent SCIM Clients update SCIM
                Resources, individual clients become out of date as state changes occur. Some clients may need to be
                informed of these changes for co-ordination or reconciliation purposes. This could be done using
                periodic SCIM GET requests over time, but this rapidly becomes problematic as the number of changes and the
                number of resources increases.
            </t>
            <t>
                Security Event Tokens <xref target="RFC8417"/> and SCIM Events offer the ability to exchange
                messages that act as triggers for receivers to monitor over time in an asynchronous approach. This
                enables greater scale and timeliness, where only changed information is exchanged between parties.
            </t>
            <t>
                A SET token conveys information about a state change that has occured in a publishing SCIM Service Provider.
                That token may be of interest to one or more receivers and can be delivered asynchronously to the originating
                SCIM Client making the change. Unlike SCIM Protocol requests which convey protocol commands, Security
                Events describe statements of fact about changes by the SCIM Service Provider. This approach allows the Event Receiver
                to determine the best local follow-up action to take within its own context. For example, the receiver can
                reconcile intentional schema and population differences between the domain.

                <t>
                    In JSON Web Tokens and Security Event Tokens, the term "claim" refers to JSON attribute
                    values in a JSON Web Token <xref target="RFC7519"/> structure. The term "claim" in tokens is used
                    to indicate that an attribute value may not be verified and its accuracy can be questioned. In the
                    context of SCIM, claims are referred to as attributes. For the purposes of this specification claims
                    and attributes are inter-changeable. For consistency, JWT and SET IANA registered attributes will
                    continue to be called claims, while event attributes (i.e. those in an event payload) will be
                    referred to as attributes.

                        The JWT specification <xref target="RFC7519"/> upon which SET is based uses the term "claims" to
                        refer to attributes in a JSON token. SCIM in contrast uses the term "attributes" to refer to
                        JSON attributes. For the purposes of this draft, the terms "attributes" and "claims" are equivalent.

                        relationships, an Event Publisher and Receiver typically exchange resource change events without
                        exchanging data. For a receiver to know the value of the data, the Event Receiver usually calls back
                        to the SCIM Event Publisher domain to receive a new copy of data (e.g. Uses a SCIM GET request).

                        the <tt>data</tt> payload attribute. This eliminates the need for a callback
                        to retrieve additional data.

                        An entity receives events typically via <xref target="RFC8935"/>, <xref target="RFC8936"/>, or

                        <xref target="RFC8935"/>, the Event Receiver is an HTTP Service Endpoint that receives requests.
                        In the case of SET Poll-Based Transfer <xref target="RFC8936"/>, the receiver is an HTTP client
                        that initiates HTTP request to an Event Publisher endpoint.

                        Service Provider. For example, events MAY be the result of a SCIM Create, Modify, or Delete
                        as defined in <xref target="RFC7644"/>. A SCIM Service Provider MAY be an Event Publisher or an
                        independent service that aggregates events into Event Receiver feeds. As described above, when
                        using <xref target="RFC8935"/>, the Event Publisher is an HTTP Client that initiates HTTP POST
                        requests to a defined Event Receiver endpoint. When using <xref target="RFC8936"/>, the Event
                        Publisher provides an HTTP endpoint which a receiver MAY use to "poll" for Security Events.

                A SCIM event is a signal, in the form of a Security Event Token <xref target="RFC8417" format="default"/>,
                that describe some event that has occurred. A SET event consists of a set of standard JWT "top-level"
                claims and an "events" claim that contains one or more event URI subclaims (JSON attributes) each with a
                JSON object containing relevant event information.

                    arise from the same transaction or resource state change for a single resource or subject. Finally,
                    as recommended in <xref target="RFC8417"/> the JWT "sub" claim SHALL NOT be used.

                <t>The following attributes are available for all events defined. Some attributes are defined as SET/JWT
                    claims, while others are "Event Payload" claims as defined in Section 1.2 <xref target="RFC8417"/>.

                    <dd>
                        For the purposes of SCIM, this SET defined claim identifies a unique transaction
                        originating at a SCIM Service Provider and/or its underlying data repository or database. The
                        claim is used to detect duplicate transactions that may have been received (e.g. in the case of
                        a re-transmitted or recovered event). The <tt>txn</tt> claim is REQUIRED.  The SET <tt>jti</tt> claim MAY be used
                        in addition to the <tt>txn</tt> claim. Where <tt>txn</tt> identifies a unique transaction within a 
                        SCIM Service Provider, multiple SETs MAY be issued each with distinct JTI's stemming from a 
                        common originating transaction with identical <tt>txn</tt> values.
                    </dd>

                        The Etag version of the resource as a result of the event and corresponds to the Etag
                        response header described in Section 3.14 of SCIM Protocol <xref target="RFC7644"/>.
                    </dd>

                        This event payload attribute contains information described in SCIM Bulk
                        Operations <tt>data</tt> attribute, Section 3.7 <xref target="RFC7644"/>. The JSON object
                        contains the equivalent SCIM command processed by the SCIM Service Provider. For example, after
                        processing a SCIM Create operation, the data contained includes the final representation of the
                        created entity by the SCIM Service Provider including the assigned <tt>id</tt> value.
                    </dd>

                    <dd>
                        This payload contains an array of attributes that were added, revised, or removed. Values of
                        modified attributes SHOULD conform to the ABNF syntax rule for <tt>path</tt>> (Section 3.5.2
                        <xref target="RFC7644"/>). For example: <br/>

                    </dd>

                <t>
                    Only one of <tt>data</tt> or <tt>attributes</tt> claims SHALL be provided depending on the event

                        their profile which has caused their resource to join a feed.

                    This section defines resource changes that have occurred within a SCIM Service Provider. These

                        attribute that was assigned by the SCIM Service Provider is shared so that all replicas in the
                        domain MAY use the same resource identifier.

                            A SCIM Client making SCIM HTTP requests defined in <xref target="RFC7644"/> MAY request
                            "asynchronous" processing using the "Prefer" HTTP Header as defined in Section 4.1
                            <xref target="RFC7240"/>. The client may do this for a number of reasons such as: avoiding
                            holding HTTP connections open during long requests, because the result of the request is not
                            needed, or for co-ordination reasons where the result is delivered to another entity for
                            further action.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            To initiate an async SCIM request, a normal SCIM protocol POST, PUT,
                            PATCH, or DELETE request is performed with the HTTP Header <tt>Prefer</tt> with a value of
                            <tt>respond-async</tt> as defined in <xref target="RFC9110"/>. The HTTP <tt>Accept</tt>
                            header SHALL be ignored.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            In response, and as indicated in the SCIM Service Provider Configuration (see
                            <xref target="serviceProviderConfig"/>, the SCIM Service Provider responds with either a
                            normal SCIM response or asynchronously by returning HTTP Status 202 Accepted.
                            The asynchronous response SHOULD contain no response body. To enable correlation of the
                            future event, the HTTP response header "Set-txn" is returned with a value corresponding
                            to a future Security Event Token to be received whose "txn" claim SHALL match. Per Section 3
                            <xref target="RFC7240"/>, the response will also include the header
                            <tt>Preference-Applied</tt>. The <tt>Location</tt> header returned SHALL be one of the following:

                            SCIM Protocol Section 3.7 <xref target="RFC7644"/> provides the ability to submit multiple
                            SCIM operations in a single request. When an asynchronous response is requested, a single
                            Async Request Completion Event SHALL be generated for each requested operation. For example,
                            if a single SCIM Bulk request had 10 operations, then 10 Async Event completions events
                            would be generated.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            The "txn" claim MUST be set to the value originally returned to the requesting SCIM Client (see
                            <xref target="asyncRequest"/>) appended with a colon (":") followed by the request operation number.
                            For example, if the "txn" claim value was "2d80e537a3f64622b0347b641ebc8f44", then the first
                            Async Response Event Token representing the first operation SHALL have a "txn" claim value of
                            "2d80e537a3f64622b0347b641ebc8f44:1", the second operation SHALL have a value of
                            "2d80e537a3f64622b0347b641ebc8f44:2", and so on.

                            If a SCIM Service Provider elects
                            to optimize the sequence of operations (per Section 3.7 <xref target="RFC7644"/>), the
                            Async Request Completion events generated MAY also be generated out of sequence from the
                            order of operations in the original request. In this case, the "txn" claims generated SHALL
                            use operation numbers that correspond to the original request order.

                        The Async Response event signals the completion of a SCIM request. The event payload contains

                        single SCIM Bulk Response Operation as per Section 3.7.3. In the event, the "txn" claim must be
                        set to the value originally returned to the requesting SCIM Client (see <xref target="asyncRequest"/>).

            <t>
                This specification depends on the Security Considerations for <xref target="RFC8417"/>. </t>
            <t>
                The use of JSON Web Encryption (JWE) <xref target="RFC7516"/> can impose performance limitations when
                used in high event frequency scenarios. JWE is useful when the transfer of SETs is not end-to-end encrypted.
                TLS termination, for example, may occur before the destination of the SET.  JWE ensures that the content of
                the SET is encrypted after TLS termination to prevent disclosure.</t>
            <t>
                For SCIM Provisioning events, the long-term series of changes may be critical to both sides. As such,
                Event Publishers SHOULD consider storing events for receivers for longer periods of time in the case of
                an extended SET Transfer service failure. Similarly, Event Receivers MUST ensure events are persisted
                directly or indirectly to meet local recovery needs before acknowledging the SET Events were received.
            </t>
            <t>
                When SET Events are stored for future delivery or retained local recovery, they MUST be limited only to the
                parties needed to support recovery or SET forwarding.
            </t>
            <t>
                JWS <xref target="RFC7515"/> signed SET Events SHOULD be used to verify authenticity of the origin of
                a SET Event. Validating event signatures is both useful on the initial transfer of SET Events, and
                may also be useful for auditing purposes. Signed SET Events are protected from tampering in the event that
                an intermediate system, such as a TLS-terminating proxy, decrypts the SET payload before sending it onward 
                to its intended recipient.
            </t>
            <t>
                In operation, some SCIM Resources such as SCIM Groups may have a high rate of change such a groups with more
                than 100k member values. This could lead to an excessive event rate that SHOULD be considered by Event
                Publishers and Receivers. Consider the following to help mitigate throughput issues:
                </t>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Avoid use of SCIM PUT (Section 3.5.1 <xref target="RFC7644"/>) operations on large groups as this may
                    require excessive locking in data store systems as well as large Security Event payloads. Use SCIM PATCH
                    (Section 3.5.2) to focus on updating and notifying about changed information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use Patch Notice (urn:ietf:params:SCIM:event:prov:patch:notice) to reduce event content combined with
                    periodic SCIM GETs (see section 3.4 <xref target="RFC7644"/>) to retrieve current group state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aggregate multiple PATCH Events into a single event. Providing the exact date of each membership change
                    is not critical but instead that the information content remains intact.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <t>
                When using Asynchronous SCIM Requests (see <xref target="asyncRequest"/>), and a location returned in
                a SCIM Accepted response is a URI for retrieving the event result, the URI SHOULD be protected requiring
                an HTTP Authorization header or some other form of client authentication.

            <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
            <t>This specification enables the sharing of information between domains. The specification assumes
            that implementers and deployers are operating under one of the following scenarios:
            </t>
            <ul>
                <li>A common administrative domain where there is one administrative owner of the data. In these cases,
                the objective is to protect privacy and security of the owner and user data by keeping information
                systems co-ordinated and up-to-date. For example, the domains decide to use Domain Based Replication
                mode in order to keep employee information synchronized.</li>
                <li>In a co-operative or co-ordinated relationship, parties have decided to share a limited amount
                of data and/or signals for the benefits of their users. Depending on end-user consent, information
                is shared on an as-authorized and/or as-needed basis. For example, the domains agree to use Co-ordinated
                Provision mode that exchanges things like account status or specific minimal attribute information
                that must be fetched on request after receiving notice of a change. This enables authorization to
                be verified each time data is transferred.</li>
            </ul>
            <t>In general, the sharing of SCIM Event information falls within a pre-existing SCIM Client and Service
            Provider relationship and carry no additional personal information.</t>
            <t>Privacy considerations of <xref target="RFC8417"/> MUST also be observed.</t>

                SCIM Events may be used in a number of ways. The following non-normative sections describe some of
                the expected uses.

                    The objective of "Domain Based Replication" events (DBR) is to synchronize resource changes between
                    SCIM Service Providers in a common administrative domain. In this mode, complete information about
                    modified resources are shared between replicas for immediate processing.

                    From a security perspective, it is assumed that servers sharing DBR events are secured by a common
                    access policy and all servers are required to be up-to-date.
                    From a privacy perspective, because all servers are in the same administrative domain, the primary objective
                    is to keep individual Service Provider nodes or cluster synchronized.

                    In "Co-ordinated Provisioning" (CP), SCIM resource change events perform the function of change
                    notification without the need to provide raw data. In any Event Publisher and Receiver
                    relationship, the set of SCIM Resources (e.g. Users) that are linked or co-ordinated is managed
                    within the context of an event feed and MAY be a subset of the total set of resources on
                    either side. For example, an event feed could be limited to users who have consented to the sharing
                    of information between domains. To support capability, "feed" specific events are defined to indicate
                    the addition and removal of SCIM Resources from a feed. For example, when a user consents to
                    the sharing of information between domains, events about the User MAY be added to the feed
                    between the Event Publisher and Receiver.

                    In CP mode, the receiver of an event must callback to the originating SCIM Service Provider
                    (e.g. using a SCIM GET request) to reconcile the newly changed resource in
                    order to obtain the changes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Co-ordinated provisioning has the following benefits:
                </t>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Differences in schema (e.g. attributes) between domains. For example, a receiving domain may
                        only be interested in or allowed to access to a few attributes (e.g. role based access data) to enable access to an
                        application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Different Event Receivers MAY have differing needs when accessing information and thus be assigned
                        varying access rights. Minimal information events combined with callbacks for data allows
                        data filtering to be applied.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Receivers can take independent action. Such as deciding which attributes or resource lifecycle
                        changes to accept. For example, in the case of a conflict, a receiver can prioritize one domain
                        source over another.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A receiver MAY throttle or buffer changes rather than act immediately on a notification. For
                        example, for a frequently changing resource, the
                        receiver MAY choose to make a scheduled SCIM GET for resources that have been marked "dirty" by
                        events received in the last scheduled cycle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <t>
                    A disadvantage of the CP approach is that it may be considered costly in the sense that each event
                    received might trigger a callback to the event issuer. This cost should be weighed against the cost
                    producing filtered information in each event for each receiver. Furthermore, a receiver is not required
                    to make a callback on every provisioning event.
                </t>

                <t>
                    It is assumed that an underlying relationship between domains exists that permits the exchange of
                    personal information and credentials. For example, in a cross-domain scenario a SCIM Service Provider
                    would have been previously authorized to perform SCIM provisioning operations and publish change events.
                    As such, appropriate confidentiality and privacy agreements should be in place between the domains.
                </t>
                <t>
                    When sharing information between parties, CP Events minimize the information shared in each message and
                    require the Security Event Receiver to receive more information from the Event Publisher as needed.
                    In this way, the Event Receiver is able to have regular access to information through normal
                    SCIM protocol access restrictions. The Event Receiver and Publisher may agree to communicate these
                    updates through a variety of transmission methods such as push and pull based HTTP like in <xref target="RFC8935"/>,
                    <xref target="RFC8936"/>, or HTTP GET (see <xref target="asyncRequest"/>), streaming technologies
                    (e.g., Kaftka or Kinesis), or via webhooks like in the <xref target="SSF" format="default">Shared Signals Framework</xref>.
